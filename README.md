# Comments
This tool helped improve my workflow while writing comments for student progress reports. Typing in the middle box automatically searches the entered text for phrases that I used frequently last year and offers matches as options. Hitting the right arrow key dumps that text into the comment box at the bottom of the screen.

You can download the files yourself by selecting 'Download Zip' at the right side of the screen. The phases are in a big array contained in the phrases.js file inside the js/ directory. You could probably put in your own phrases and this would work well for you.

I wrote about this experiment at http://evanweinberg.com/2015/10/09/teacherscoding-improving-report-writing-with-commenthelper/ .
